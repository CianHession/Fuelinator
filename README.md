## What is Fuelinator?
Fuelinator is a React.js app, which finds you the cheapest fuel prices in Ireland with possible expansion of any location you search for.

Fuelinator will use the Google Maps API and fuel APIS in Ireland.

You will need to create an account to use the Fuelinator, this can be done on launch of the app.

The project idea was made in response to the global rise in fuel prices over the past year.

The app will also use Node.js and MongoDB/SQL aswell as geo-location within the app.

## Requirements/How To Start The App?
In order to run the app, you will need to install Node.js. <br>
