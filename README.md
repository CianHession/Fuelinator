## What is Fuelinator?
Fuelinator is a React.js app, which finds you the cheapest fuel prices in your location, or any location you search for.

You can register and log in as a user in order to submit updated fuel prices, you will be required to type the fuel prices, as-well as submitting a photo proving the prices, which then will be reviewed and accepted.

The project idea was made in response to the global rise in fuel prices over the past year.

The app will also use Node.js and MongoDB/SQL aswell as geo-location within the app.
